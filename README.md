Hi Squatters,
After getting asked about our streaming software setups Splicer and I, synthie, decided to compile a handy list for you. Please find our recommendations below.


## Essential

| Firebot | [Website](https://firebot.app) / [Support on Discord](https://discord.gg/crowbartools) | Firebot is a chatbot for Twitch that includes the option to have interactive elements (e.g. Follower notifications) directly on your own machine. |

## Additional Software
