# S.Q.U.A.T. Streaming Tool Recommendation

Hi Squatters,
After getting asked about our streaming software setups Splicer and I, synthie, decided to compile a handy list for you. Please find our recommendations below.


## Essential
| Name | Link | Description |
|----|----|----|
| Open Broadcaster Software (OBS Studio) | [Website](https://obsproject.com/) | OBS is the essential, free tool to stream content from your PC to Twitch and the like. It is highly recommended to use OBS over SLOBS             |
| Firebot | [Website](https://firebot.app) / [Support on Discord](https://discord.gg/crowbartools) | Firebot is a chatbot for Twitch that includes the option to have interactive elements (e.g. Follower notifications) directly on your own machine. |

## Additional Software


## OBS Plugins
| Name          | Link           | Description |
|----|----|----|
| Input Overlay | [OBS Plugins](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/input-overlay.552/) | Displays Controller, Mouse or Keyboards inputs in a beautified overlay. |
| win-capture-audio | [OBS Plugins](https://github.com/bozbez/win-capture-audio) | Allows you to define programs as Audio Input. That way you can stream game audio while listening to music / a voice chat in the background without streaming that. |
| obs-websocket | [OBS Plugins](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-obs-studio-from-websockets.466/) | Allows other programms (e.g. Firebot, Macrodeck) to communicate with your OBS. Setting a password is recommen. |
| StreamFX | [Github](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/releases) | Adds a ton of effects to OBS. Can be useful. |
